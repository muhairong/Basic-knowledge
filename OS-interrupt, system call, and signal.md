## Interrupt
Interrupts are **signals sent to the CPU by external devices**, normally I/O devices. They tell the CPU to stop its current activities and execute the appropriate part of the operating system.

There are three types of interrupts:

* **Hardware Interupts** are generated by hardware devices to signal that they need some attention from the OS. They may have just received some data (e.g., keystrokes on the keyboard or an data on the ethernet card); or they have just completed a task which the operating system previous requested, such as transfering data between the hard drive and memory.
* **Software Interupts** are generated by programs when they want to **request a system call** to be performed by the operating system.
* **Traps** are generated by the CPU itself to indicate that some error or condition occured for which assistance from the operating system is needed.

The CPU performs the following actions in response to an interrupt:

* Using the pointer to the current process control block, the state and all register values for the process are saved for use when the process is later restarted.
* The CPU mode bit is switched to supervisory mode.
* Using the pointer to the interrupt handler table and the interrupt vector, the location of the kernel code to execute is determined. The interrupt vector is the IRQ for hardware interrupts (read from an interrupt controller register) and an argument to the interrupt assembly language instruction for software interrupts.
* Processing is switched to the appropriate portion of the kernel.

## System call
A request from an application program for the operating system to perform some hardware action on behalf of the application. System calls are initiated with a software interrupt assembly language instruction. The argument to the interrupt instruction is a number, which corresponds to the index of an array in the OS kernel with pointers to the functions that provide the requested service.
For user applications access kernel space.
* System call use a software interrupt: INT 0x80, and the #128 interruption handle program is system call.
* The sys_call_table stores the start address of system call funstions. The offset of it stores different system call functions address. 
* System call id stores in EAX register, using this to find corresponding handle function.
* Parameters can be passed in registers.
* Return value stores in eax.

## Signal
Signals are a limited form of inter-process communication (IPC). A signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process or to a specific thread within the same process in order to notify it of an event that occurred. 

When a signal is sent, the operating system interrupts the target process' normal flow of execution to deliver the signal. Execution can be interrupted during any non-atomic instruction. If the process has previously registered a signal handler, that routine is executed. Otherwise, the default signal handler is executed.

Signals are similar to interrupts, the difference being that interrupts are mediated by the processor and handled by the kernel while signals are mediated by the kernel (possibly via system calls) and handled by processes. The kernel may pass an interrupt as a signal to the process that caused it (typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE).
